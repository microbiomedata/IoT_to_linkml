      format, but we suggest that you make it concise, unique and consistent within
      your lab, and as informative as possible. INSDC requires every sample name from
      a single Submitter to be unique. Use of a globally unique identifier for the
      field source_mat_id is recommended in addition to sample_name.

    description: Salinity is the total concentration of all dissolved salts in a liquid
      or solid (in the form of an extract obtained by centrifugation) sample. While
      salinity can be measured by a complete chemical analysis, this method is difficult
      and time consuming. More often, it is instead derived from the conductivity
      measurement. This is known as practical salinity. These derivations compare
      the specific conductance of the sample to a salinity standard such as seawater
