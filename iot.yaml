    description: Altitude is a term used to identify heights of objects such as airplanes,

      which is above the earth's surface. In this context, the altitude measurement
      is the vertical distance between the earth's surface above sea level and the
      sampled position in the air

      subsequent sequencing. The identifier can refer either to the original material
      collected or to any derived sub-samples. The INSDC qualifiers /specimen_voucher,
      /bio_material, or /culture_collection may or may not share the same value as
      the source_mat_id field. For instance, the /specimen_voucher qualifier and source_mat_id
      may both contain 'UAM:Herps:14' , referring to both the specimen voucher and
      sampled tissue with the same identifier. However, the /culture_collection qualifier
      may refer to a value from an initial culture (e.g. ATCC:11775) while source_mat_id
      would refer to an identifier from some derived culture from which the nucleic
      acids were extracted (e.g. xatc123 or ark:/2154/R2).
